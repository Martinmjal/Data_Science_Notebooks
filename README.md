# Welcome to my Data Science Journey!

If you've reached this page, thank you for taking the time to read the [content I've created while learning data science](https://martinmjal.github.io/Data_Science_Notebooks/intro.html).

I also hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Please feel free to extract the CSV files from  this repository, from which I generated this book.

Furthermore, if you have any comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to share them with me via my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinalvarez2000/).
