# Welcome to my learning path!

If you've reached this page, thank you for taking the time to read the content I've created while learning data science. I also hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Please feel free to extract the CSV files from  [My github repository](https://github.com/Martinmjal/Data_Science_Notebooks) from which I generated this book.

Furthermore, if you have any comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to share them with me via my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinalvarez2000/).
